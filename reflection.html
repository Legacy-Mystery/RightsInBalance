    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h3>I adapted my writings into easy to read images, which being a slide deck, a mind map, and a pamphlet . I made the informational essay into a slide deck so thaqt each paragraphs main points were more easily identifiable. I chose a red/pink color scheme to invoke that sense of passion in the viewer. For the annotated Bibliography I made a mind map so that people could use the keywords of each source to find the exact ones or similar, with choosing a blue color palette to bring about a feeling of calmness and introspection. While with the grant proposal I used a pamphlet  that will be placed around campus to inform people of the situation and let people know they're not alone. To coincide with that I used a more gold and yellow color scheme to incite energy and hope that things can change.</h3>
