    <h1>Reflection</h1>
  <h3>
      I adapted my writings into easy-to-read images, which included a slide deck, a mind map, and a pamphlet . I made the informational essay into a slide deck so that each paragraph's main points were more easily identifiable. I chose a red/pink color scheme to invoke that sense of passion in the viewer. For the annotated Bibliography I made a mind map so that people could use the keywords of each source to find the exact ones or similar, with choosing a blue color palette to bring about a feeling of calmness and introspection. While with the grant proposal I used a pamphlet  that will be placed around campus to inform people of the situation and let people know they're not alone. To coincide with that I used a more gold and yellow color scheme to incite energy and hope that things can change. I chose to use code.org because the platform allows me to shape my design with the flexibility of the code and the ability to see live updates on the preview. This let me see how each change affected the format and look of the page. It also allowed me to have full creative control on my website's appearance. I then copied the code from there onto github.com so that it would be with my other websites, because having them all in one place is more convenient. A few rhetorical moves I changed was making dense text blocks into short, concise bullet points and adding visuals to improve clarity. I removed a bunch of academic filler words to make it more accessible for an everyday audience and added color psychology to evoke emotion. When taking the audience into account, I decided to choose formats that are easy to navigate and visually appealing while making sure everything is accessible to people with color blindness and making sure that all text is large enough that it is easy to see.  </h3>    <img src="reflection.jpg" alt="Image description" />
