    <h2>Meet the Author</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is TrevorJay Andrews. I am a undergraduate student at USC Sumter, in Dr. Wallace's English 101 class. My work focuses on the intersection of law, culture, and civil rights, driven by a commitment to ensuring that institutional support is actively affirming, not just passively tolerant, of all students. As someone who has witnessed the tensions between belief and belonging firsthand, my research aims to find concrete solutions to deeply ingrained problems in conservative regions.</p>

      <h2>Portfolio's Purpose</h2>
      <p>The aim of this portfolio is to thoroughly examine the escalating clash of religious freedom versus LGBTQ+ rights in the USA, and in the end to support local, structural solutions that respect and protect human dignity. The main point made is that religious freedom is a guaranteed right, but at the same time, its claiming should not be allowed to cover up discrimination, which is not clear-cut where faith-based advocacy is and harm to structure is done. This paper investigates the ways in which legal safeguards and the way issues are presented can accidentally legitimize exclusionary practices if such practices are dressed in the cloak of moral concern.</p>
